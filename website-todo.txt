---------------IDEAS----------------------
Users followed box on profile page:
	- Show 6 and have "show all" button that brings up a bigger box with a scroll and search?

Celebrations page
	- Basically a statistics page but try to put as much wierd and wonderful css and javascript in there as possible
	- "You must have run at least 1km to celebrate."
	- Button that just says "Celebrate"

	CSS
	- Backwards and forwards elements using left or top or whatever
	- Transform

Make logo of running man go backwards and forwards

Make sure users can't make events backwards in time (or within say 30 minutes)

---------------BUGS------------------------
