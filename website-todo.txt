Social running (and potentially walking/cycling) planning platform	
	- Users create an account and can then create running events with the following information:
		- Starting point
		- Route
		- Distance
		- Date and time
		- Public/private
	- Other people can then click going
	- Alternative to a running club that can be a bit more flexible
	- I would start by aiming this just towards my home town
	- Could be extended for walking/cycling
	- Should handle gpx files
	- Connect to strava somehow?

---map.js---
- Changing coordinate input elements should then move the map markers

Try to break create event




---------------IDEAS----------------------
Users followed box on profile page:
	- Show 6 and have "show all" button that brings up a bigger box with a scroll and search?

Celebrations page
	- Basically a statistics page but try to put as much wierd and wonderful css and javascript in there as possible
	- "You must have run at least 1km to celebrate."
	- Button that just says "Celebrate"

	CSS
	- Backwards and forwards elements using left or top or whatever
	- Transform

Make logo of running man go backwards and forwards

Make sure users can't make events backwards in time (or within say 30 minutes)
Split users events into finished/active
Paginate events
Paginate users
Filter events by proximity

---------------BUGS------------------------
- Not all images take up the same space. Some images are smaller
- When you reduce the width of the screen on the profile page, the profile picture is no longer a circle
- Profile bio doesn't keep line breaks
